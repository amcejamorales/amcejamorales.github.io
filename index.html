      "The origins of carrot cake are disputed. Many food historians believe carrot cake originated from Medieval carrot puddings eaten by Europeans. This evolution is said to be originated during the Middle Ages when sugar and sweeteners were expensive for most individuals and often hard to find, so many people used carrots as a substitute for sugar.[2] Recipes for carrot cake occur as early as 1827, in a French cookbook published in England.[3] Another 19th-century recipe comes from the housekeeping school of Kaiseraugst (Canton of Aargau, Switzerland).[4] According to the Culinary Heritage of Switzerland, it is one of the most popular cakes in Switzerland, especially for the birthdays of children.

      The popularity of carrot cake was revived in the United Kingdom because of rationing during the Second World War."

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a separate bowl whisk oil, eggs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, pineapple, and vanilla extract. Mix in the grated carrots.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine wet ingredients with dry ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the cake batter into the cake pans. Bake for 30 - 35 minutes. Cool in the cake pans for 20 - 25 minutes, then transfer to wire rack and allow cakes to finish cooling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat the cream cheese then mix in the butter. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract and mix until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Level the cakes so they're perfectly flat. Place one cake on a cake stand and evenly spread 1/2 cup frosting on top. Place the second cake on top and use the remaining frosting on the top and sides of the cake.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optional: use green and orange food-coloring and a piping bag to add carrot decorations to the top of the cake.
        </li>
